# Introduction
Welcome to the Nerf Center!

This project allows you to manage your IoT Nerf Guns.  You can see their status (Online, Offline, Launching) and actual launch darts from the dashboard.

I'm also hosting [a working version of this project](https://mvilrokx.github.io/nerf-gun-control-center), just log on to your own MQTT Broker.
